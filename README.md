# ASIC-Design-of-a-Booth-Multiplier-for-High-Speed-Binary-Multiplication
This document presents the ASIC design and physical implementation of a high-speed Booth Multiplier optimized for signed number multiplication. The design is based on the Booth algorithm, which reduces the number of partial products, improving overall multiplication speed and efficiency. Implemented using Verilog HDL, the design follows a complete RTL-to-GDSII flow utilizing Synopsys EDA tools.
The development begins with functional verification using Synopsys VCS to ensure logical correctness. Post-verification, synthesis is carried out using Synopsys Design Compiler to convert the RTL code into an optimized gate-level netlist. The synthesis process focuses on improving performance, reducing area, and minimizing power consumption.
Following synthesis, the physical design phase is executed using Synopsys IC Compiler II. This includes key steps such as floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing. Each step is carefully optimized to meet critical timing, power, and area constraints. Clock tree synthesis is particularly important in reducing skew and ensuring reliable timing across the design.
The process concludes with the generation of the GDSII file, which is the final physical layout ready for fabrication. This Booth Multiplier demonstrates reduced critical path delay and improved performance compared to conventional multipliers.
The optimized flow and use of the Booth algorithm make this design highly suitable for high-speed digital applications such as signal processing and embedded computing. Overall, the project showcases the effectiveness of combining algorithmic efficiency with advanced ASIC design methodologies using industry-standard tools.
